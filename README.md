# MLB Clutch ⚾️ - Hack Reddit 2025

## Inspiration
The real inspiration behind creating this application is a deep love for baseball and the lack of a solution that makes following MLB matches more fun and thrilling.

## What it does
The sole purpose of the application is to engage MLB fans, and it does so by providing real-time match updates. Additionally, users can earn streak points by showcasing their MLB knowledge. These streak points allow users to climb to the top of the leaderboard.

## How we built it
The application is built using Reddit's Devvit platform. It also integrates a third-party, publicly available API from the MLB. For the frontend, React, Framer Motion, and TailwindCSS were used throughout the application. Additionally, we used GenAI APIs from OpenAI.

## Challenges we ran into
Below are a few challenges I ran into and the steps taken to overcome them:
- Firstly, communicating with the Devvit application from the webview was challenging. Since it was my first time working with webviews, referring to the official documentation was very helpful.
- Secondly, ensuring that the quiz questions were dynamically generated. This was achieved by integrating OpenAI into the application.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- I’m very happy that I was able to create something that I wanted and that people around me enjoy.
- I'm also proud of designing a decent UI/UX for the end users, which made the overall experience more engaging.

## What we learned
- Learning about webviews and understanding how powerful they are was the biggest takeaway.
- I learned about Reddit's Devvit platform and its ability to create advanced, complex designs using simple blocks.

## What's next for MLB Clutch ⚾️
- To begin with, I plan to integrate friendly betting, where users can bet their earned streak points on a team.
- Additionally, I’ll be adding a live polling feature where users can vote for their favorite teams.
